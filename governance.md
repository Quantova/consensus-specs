# Governance

## 1. Introduction
Governance is a critical component of decentralized networks, ensuring that protocol upgrades, economic policies, and community decisions are executed transparently. Quantova Network’s governance model is designed to be **fully decentralized, community-driven, and adaptable**, allowing stakeholders to propose and vote on network changes without requiring centralized intervention.

## 2. Comparative Analysis of Governance Models

| Feature              | Ethereum | Polkadot | Quantova |
|----------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Governance Type     | Off-chain (EIPs) | On-chain Referenda | On-chain  |
| Upgrade Mechanism  | Hard Forks | Forkless Upgrades | Forkless Upgrades |
| Stakeholder Influence | Miners & Developers | Token Holders & Council Members | Token Holders & Validators |
| Treasury System    | No formal treasury | On-chain Treasury | On-chain Treasury |

### 2.1 Ethereum Governance
Ethereum’s governance relies on **Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)**, which are proposed by developers and discussed off-chain before being implemented via **hard forks**. While this model allows for flexibility, it also introduces **centralization risks** as key decisions are influenced by a small group of core developers.

### 2.2 Polkadot Governance
Polkadot employs an **on-chain governance model**, where token holders vote on referenda, and a **Council & Technical Committee** play a role in emergency decision-making. This system provides a balance between decentralization and structured decision-making.

### 2.3 Quantova Governance Model
Quantova adopts an **on-chain governance** system similar to Polkadot but removes the council, ensuring that **all decisions are directly made by token holders and validators.**

Key aspects include:
- **Decentralized Proposals**: Any token holder can submit a governance proposal.
- **Validator and Token Holder Voting**: Decisions are made through on-chain voting mechanisms.
- **Treasury Allocation**: A percentage of transaction fees is reserved for ecosystem development, security audits, and research.
- **Smart Contract-Based Execution**: Governance decisions are executed automatically using smart contracts to ensure transparency and trust.

## 3. Treasury Management & Funding

### 3.1 Treasury Allocation
Quantova’s **on-chain treasury** ensures that protocol improvements, security enhancements, and community initiatives receive adequate funding. The treasury is **funded through a percentage of transaction fees** and is governed via on-chain proposals.

#### Treasury Funds Distribution:
- **50%**: Network Development (R&D, security audits, and infrastructure upgrades).
- **25%**: Validator Incentives & Network Security.
- **15%**: Community Grants & Developer Support.
- **10%**: Marketing, Partnerships & Growth Initiatives.

## 4. Conclusion
Quantova’s **Pure Proof-of-Stake Consensus and GRANDPA finality mechanism** ensure the network’s **security, efficiency, and scalability**, while its **on-chain governance model** ensures that decision-making remains decentralized, transparent, and inclusive. By leveraging **quantum-resistant cryptography, a robust treasury system, and community-driven proposals**, Quantova sets a new standard for decentralized blockchain governance.
