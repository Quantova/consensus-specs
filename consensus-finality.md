# Consensus & Finality Mechanisms

## 1. Introduction
Consensus and finality mechanisms are fundamental to any blockchain network, ensuring that transactions are verified, secure, and irreversible. Quantova Network employs a **Pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** consensus model combined with the **GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement) finality protocol** to achieve high security, scalability, and decentralization. This document provides an in-depth analysis of Quantova's consensus and finality mechanisms, their security implications, and a comparison with other blockchain models.

## 2. Pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Security Model

### 2.1 Purpose
The **Pure Proof-of-Stake (PoS)** consensus mechanism replaces energy-intensive mining with a **quantum-secure, stake-based validation system**. It ensures decentralization while resisting **Sybil attacks and quantum threats** through cryptographic innovations like **CRYSTALS-Dilithium signatures and SHA-3-based randomness.**

### 2.2 Technical Specifications

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Consensus Algorithm | CRYSTALS-Dilithium + GRANDPA Finality |
| Validator Selection | Stake-weighted + Quantum-Secure VRFs |
| Block Time | 6 seconds |
| Slashing Conditions | Double-signing, Downtime |
| Reward Distribution | Proportional to stake and uptime |

### 2.3 Workflow

#### Step 1: Validator Onboarding
- **Stake Tokens:** A user locks tokens in a staking contract to become a validator.
  - Minimum stake: **1,000 tokens** (adjustable via governance).
- **Key Generation:** Generate **Dilithium keys (public/private)** for block signing.

#### Step 2: Epoch Randomness
- **VRF-Based Selection:** Validators compute a **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)** output using **SHA-3** to determine block producers for the epoch.
- **Weighted Sampling:** Validators are chosen with probability proportional to their stake.

#### Step 3: Block Production
- **Block Creation:** Selected validators package transactions into blocks and sign headers with **Dilithium private keys**.
- **Finalization:** The **GRANDPA finality gadget** ensures irreversible block confirmation after **2/3 validator approval**.

#### Step 4: Rewards and Penalties
- **Rewards:** Validators earn **100% of transaction fees + block rewards (new tokens).**
- **Slashing:** Malicious validators lose **10% of their stake** for attacks (e.g., double-signing).

### 2.4 Quantum-Secure Components
- **Dilithium Signatures:**
  - Replaces **SR25519**.
  - Resistant to **Shor’s Algorithm** due to **LWE/SIS lattice hardness**.
- **SHA-3 VRFs:**
  - Ensures randomness is unpredictable even to quantum adversaries.

## 3. Finality Mechanism: GRANDPA

### 3.1 Overview
Finality ensures that once a transaction is confirmed, it is **permanently recorded** and cannot be reversed. Quantova Network employs **GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement)** to achieve **rapid and secure block finalization.**

### 3.2 How GRANDPA Works
Unlike traditional Nakamoto consensus models where finality is probabilistic, GRANDPA ensures deterministic finality through the following process:
1. Validators vote on blocks in sequential rounds.
2. If a supermajority (two-thirds of validators) confirms a block, it becomes **finalized**, along with all its preceding blocks.
3. This **recursive finalization** ensures that past blocks cannot be re-organized, making transaction history immutable.

### 3.3 Benefits of GRANDPA Finality Protocol
- **Fast Confirmation Times**: Finalization can occur in seconds, reducing uncertainty for users and developers.
- **Security Against Forks**: Ensures that finalized blocks cannot be reversed, eliminating the risk of chain splits.
- **Scalability**: Enables the network to process high transaction volumes while maintaining secure and efficient finalization.

### 3.4 Security Enhancements
Quantova enhances GRANDPA’s security by integrating **quantum-resistant digital signatures**, ensuring all validator votes remain tamper-proof even against quantum adversaries.
