# Security Model

This document describes the security assumptions, attack resistance, and economic security mechanisms of the Quantova blockchain.

## Security Assumptions

Quantova's Proof of Stake model ensures integrity through economic and cryptographic principles:

- **<1/3 of validators are malicious** – GRANDPA assumes at least two-thirds are honest
- **Validators follow economic incentives** – Slashing deters dishonest behavior
- **Stable network connectivity** – Validators require reliable communication

## Resistance to Attacks

### Sybil Attacks

Prevented via staking requirements, making attacks economically costly. To control the network, an attacker would need to acquire and stake a significant portion of the total token supply.

### Censorship Resistance

Transactions are propagated across a decentralized validator set. The network's design ensures that no single validator or small group can censor transactions, as blocks are proposed by different validators in a probabilistic manner.

### Forks & Reorganizations

GRANDPA finality prevents deep reorganizations, ensuring immutability of finalized blocks. Once a block is finalized, it cannot be reverted unless there is a significant attack involving at least 1/3 of the total stake.

## Economic Security & Slashing

### Double Signing

Signing conflicting chains results in severe slashing penalties. Validators who sign two different blocks at the same height will lose a significant portion of their stake.

### Inactivity

Extended downtime leads to penalties. Validators who fail to participate in consensus for extended periods will gradually lose a portion of their stake.

### Malicious Behavior

Severe violations may result in permanent removal from the validator set and significant stake slashing.

## Long-Range Attacks

Quantova's consensus mechanism includes protections against long-range attacks through subjective finality and checkpointing mechanisms. Newly syncing nodes verify recent finality proofs signed by the current validator set.

## Operational Security Recommendations

### Validator Key Management

- Use separate keys for staking and validator operations
- Consider hardware security modules (HSMs) for key storage
- Implement proper backup procedures for all keys

### Network Security

- Run validators behind firewalls with minimal exposed ports
- Use DDoS protection services
- Implement secure VPN connections between validator infrastructure

### Monitoring and Response

- Set up comprehensive monitoring systems
- Establish incident response procedures
- Regularly review security measures and update as needed

## Audits and Third-Party Reviews

Quantova's consensus mechanism and implementation have been audited by independent security firms. Audit reports are available in the [security documentation repository](https://github.com/Quantova/security-docs).
