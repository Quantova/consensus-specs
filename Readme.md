# Quantova Blockchain: Consensus Report

## Overview

Quantova is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain built on the Substrate framework, utilizing a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) consensus model. Designed for scalability, security, and decentralization, Quantova ensures fast transaction finality and seamless integration with existing blockchain ecosystems.

### Key Features:
- **EVM Compatibility** – Supports Ethereum-style signatures, allowing developers to use tools like MetaMask, Remix, Hardhat, and Web3.js.
- **Fast Finality** – Utilizes GRANDPA consensus for deterministic finality, ensuring finalized blocks cannot be reverted.
- **High Throughput** – Blocks are produced every 3 seconds for efficient transaction processing.
- **Decentralized Validator Set** – NPoS ensures fair selection, automatic rotation, and economic security mechanisms.
- **Robust Security** – Implements strict slashing conditions for malicious validators and enforces censorship resistance.

## Consensus Mechanism

Quantova leverages the **GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive Ancestor Deriving Prefix Agreement)** consensus protocol, ensuring secure and efficient block finalization.

### **Finality and Block Time**
- Block production occurs every **3 seconds**.
- Finalization depends on network conditions but is typically achieved within seconds, ensuring rapid settlement.

### **Validator Selection & Staking**
- Validators must stake tokens to participate in consensus.
- Token holders can delegate their stake to trusted validators.
- Selection is probabilistic, based on stake weight, ensuring fair distribution.
- **Automatic validator rotation** after each era prevents centralization.

### **Slashing & Validator Penalties**
- **Double Signing:** Signing conflicting blocks results in penalties.
- **Downtime/Inactivity:** Validators failing to participate risk slashing.
- **Malicious Behavior:** Severe violations may lead to removal from the network.

## Validator & Node Participation

### **Becoming a Validator or Running a Node**
- **Full Nodes:** Contribute to network decentralization.
- **Validator Nodes:** Participate in block production and finalization.
- **Nominators:** Delegate stake to validators and earn rewards.

### **Hardware Requirements for Validators**
| Component | Minimum Requirement | Recommended |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **CPU**   | Dual-core         | 4+ cores    |
| **RAM**   | 8GB               | 16GB        |
| **Storage** | 512GB SSD        | 1TB SSD     |

### **Staking & Governance**
- No **KYC requirements**, allowing permissionless participation.
- Validators must adhere to on-chain governance rules to avoid penalties.

### **Incentives: Rewards & Slashing**
- Validators earn **staking rewards & transaction fees**.
- Nominators receive a share of staking rewards based on delegated stake.
- **Slashing:** Penalties for downtime, double signing, or malicious actions.

## Security Assumptions

Quantova’s Proof of Stake model ensures integrity through economic and cryptographic principles:
- **<1/3 of validators are malicious** – GRANDPA assumes at least two-thirds are honest.
- **Validators follow economic incentives** – Slashing deters dishonest behavior.
- **Stable network connectivity** – Validators require reliable communication.

### **Resistance to Attacks**
- **Sybil Attacks:** Prevented via staking requirements, making attacks costly.
- **Censorship Resistance:** Transactions are propagated across a decentralized validator set.
- **Forks & Reorganizations:** GRANDPA prevents deep reorgs, ensuring immutability.

### **Economic Security & Slashing**
- **Double Signing:** Signing conflicting chains results in slashing.
- **Inactivity:** Extended downtime leads to penalties.
- **Malicious Behavior:** Severe violations may result in permanent removal.

---

## Liveness & Fault Tolerance

Quantova remains operational even if a portion of its validators go offline.

### **Handling Offline Validators**
- GRANDPA requires **2/3 of validators online** to finalize blocks.
- Validators missing duties risk slashing or removal.

### **Recovery from Network Splits**
- **Short-term splits:** Majority validators continue finalizing blocks.
- **Long-term splits:** Honest validators eventually finalize the longest valid chain.

---

## Upgradability

Quantova supports flexible on-chain governance and forkless upgrades, allowing seamless protocol evolution.

### **Consensus Upgrades & Governance**
- Token holders and validators vote on network upgrades.
- Runtime upgrades modify consensus rules without requiring node restarts.
- **Hard Forks** are only used for major security or consensus changes.
